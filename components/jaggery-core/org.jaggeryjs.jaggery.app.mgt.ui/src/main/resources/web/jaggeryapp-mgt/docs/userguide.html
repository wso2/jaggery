<h1>Deploying Jaggery Applications</h1>



<p>WSO2 AppServer supports Apache tomcat based Jaggery application deployment as a latest feature. Now you can Deploy your custom Jaggery application under WSO2 AppServer. All you need to do is to bundle your Jaggery application as a '.war' archive with all your Jaggery application-related resources  and all third party libraries needed, and then deploy the archive.</p>

<p>To deploy the Jaggery application, all you have to do is locate
the archive file and upload it. </p>

<h2>Uploading Jaggery Archive Files</h2>

<p>To upload your Jaggery archive file, you first need to have all the class
files and the service.xml files in the archive directory. Thereafter, you can
create the archive file. </p>

<p>The folder structure of the Jaggery archive file will be as follows.</p>

    <pre>
        HellowWorld.war
            index.html
            *.jss
            images/
    </pre>

  upload. If you want to add multiple services at the same time, click on the 
<strong>'+'</strong> sign at the right side, and new additional entry to upload a service archive 
will appear each time you click. So you can select all the services you want and deploy them at the same time.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Running Jaggery Applications</strong></em> page
    appears. Subsequently, if the Jaggery application is successful, it will appear in

    Groups link will appear. You can click the link to view the errors.</li>
</ol>

interface.Several options are available to control your Jaggery application.</p>
