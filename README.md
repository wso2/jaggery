{jaggery.js} - The delicious Javascript framework
============================================

Jaggery is a framework to write webapps and HTTP-focused web services 
for all aspects of the application: front-end, communication, server-side
logic and persistence in pure Javascript. One of the intents of this
framework is to reduce the gap between writing web apps and web services.
Jaggery is open-source and released under Apache 2.0.

As a pure Javascript server-side scripting engine, Jaggery combines all
the strengths of Javascript with flexibility and freedom at both the
development and deployment stages. Most JavaScript webapp development
mechanisms restrict developers to a framework-specific structure or
patterns, which demand an additional learning curve. By contrast, with
Jaggery, any developers who are versed in Javascript have everything
they need to get going.
