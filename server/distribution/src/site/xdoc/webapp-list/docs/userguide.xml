<h2>Applications - User Guide</h2>

    <p>A successful application can be easily tested through the user
       interface. Several options are available to control your application.</p>
    <br/>

<h2>Unified Application Listing</h2>

       The <em><strong>Running Applications</strong></em> page appears. Here we have a unified listing
       of web applications, jax-ws/rs applications and jaggery applications.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A page with your web application name appears. It contains the operations
            available for your web application.
        </li>

         CARBON_HOME/epository/deployment/webapps. These archive files will be deployed as web
         applications. </p>
    <br/>
