This file explains the usages of all the scipts contained within
this directory.

1. chpasswd.sh & chpasswd.bat
    - Utiliy for changing the passwords of users registered in the CARBON user
      database

	This script is designed to be used with any databases. Tested with H2,MSSQL and Derby. H2 database is embedded with CARBON. 
	Open a console/shell and run the script from "$CARBON_HOME/bin" directory.

	Usage:
	# chpasswd.bat/sh --db-url jdbc:h2:/$CARBON_HOME/repository/database/WSO2CARBON_DB

	If the administrator wants to use other databases, he should configure the datasource in the "master-datasources.xml", which is in 
	"$CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/datasources" directory. This datasource is lookedup in "registry.xml" and "user-mgt.xml" as a JNDI resource.
  	He also needs to keep the drivers of the database inside the "$CARBON_HOME/repository/components/lib" directory.

	For eg,
	If you need to use MSSQL as your DB,
	a. Put the MSSQL driver inside the "$CARBON_HOME/repository/components/lib" directory.
	b. Edit the datasource in master-datasources.xml file with your database's url, username, password and drivername details. 

	eg:
	<datasource>
            <name>WSO2_CARBON_DB</name>
            <description>The datasource used for registry and user manager</description>
            <jndiConfig>
                <name>jdbc/WSO2CarbonDB</name>
            </jndiConfig>
            <definition type="RDBMS">
                <configuration>
                    <url>jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://10.100.1.68:1433/USERDB</url>
                    <username>USER</username>
                    <password>USER</password>
                    <driverClassName>net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver</driverClassName>
                    <maxActive>50</maxActive>
                    <maxWait>60000</maxWait>
                    <testOnBorrow>true</testOnBorrow>
                    <validationQuery>SELECT 1</validationQuery>
                    <validationInterval>30000</validationInterval>
                </configuration>
            </definition>
        </datasource>

	c. The above datasource is looked up using JNDI in "registry.xml" and "usr-mgt.xml" as below.
	
	In registry.xml;
	
	eg:
	<dbConfig name="wso2registry">
        	<dataSource>jdbc/WSO2CarbonDB</dataSource>
    	</dbConfig>

	In usr-mgt.xml;

	eg:
	<Configuration>
                <AdminRole>admin</AdminRole>
                <AdminUser>
                     <UserName>admin</UserName>
                     <Password>admin</Password>
                </AdminUser>
            <EveryOneRoleName>everyone</EveryOneRoleName>
            <Property name="dataSource">jdbc/WSO2CarbonDB</Property>
            <Property name="MultiTenantRealmConfigBuilder">org.wso2.carbon.user.core.config.multitenancy.SimpleRealmConfigBuilder</Property>
        </Configuration>

	d. Open a console/shell and run the script from "$CARBON_HOME/bin" directory having shutdown the server.
	
	Usage:
	# chpasswd.bat/sh --db-url jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://10.100.1.68:1433/USERDB --db-driver net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver --db-username USER --db-password USER

	e. Now you can access the admin console with your new password.

	NOTE:- To create your own database, you need to put the driver into the "$CARBON_HOME/repository/components/extensions" directory.
        Then, start the server with "-Dsetup" option.

	Usage:
	# wso2server.bat/sh -Dsetup
	It will create the tables. Thereafter shutdown the server and open a console/shell and run the script as enumerated above.
	You may delete the driver, which is inside the "$CARBON_HOME/repository/components/extensions" directory, as it is no more required.
